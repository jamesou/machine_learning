Based on this architecture mentioned in the paper above, it can provide all types of data to support and optimise the process of machine learning applications in various industries. For instance, there are image recognition and classification, natural language processing, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, financial risk control, industrial manufacturing, autonomous driving, game intelligence, network security, environmental protection, and so on. In this paper, we take the implementation of diabetes prediction in the medical industry as a case study for concrete code implementation.
