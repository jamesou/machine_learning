{/* This file just defines some basic settings variables 
â€“ API_SERVER and the SESSION_DURATION. 
The API_SERVER defines the URL at which our django_app backend is running. 
This URL would be different for the development and production environments, 
as in production we would be hosting our app on a cloud server. 
Therefore instead of changing it within the actual code, 
we are defining a settings file, where we can change the values really 
easily. The other environment variable SESSION_DUARTION defines the time 
after which the user is automatically logged out from the browser */}
